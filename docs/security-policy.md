# GitHub utilization

User with write (and force push) access to the repository must conform to the following guidelines:
- Git write access must be utilized through an encrypted SSH key, which cannot be used as the SSH key for production access.
- Two-Factor Authentication must be enabled.
- The credentials must be rotated every 12 months, which is managed through an assigned ticket with a due date.
